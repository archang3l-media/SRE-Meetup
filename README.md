# SRE Meetup Git Repository

This is the repository with my slides and Ansible Roles I used for the SRE Meetup Presentation.
The slides were made with [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) by Hakim El Hattab.

If you see Bugs or improvements, feel free to add an Issue.

Thanks to Third Republic for the format and the chance to hold my presentation.

Slides and Code are unter MIT License unless stated otherwise.
